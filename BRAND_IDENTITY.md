## 🪞 Logo / Wordmark

**Logotype:**  
Use **COSOS** (all caps) in the mark for clarity and symmetry.

**Design Notes:**
- The letterforms are naturally balanced (C–S symmetry)
- Consider a slightly customized geometric sans (e.g., modify "O" or "S" to echo motion or flow)
- Optional detail: a subtle connective ligature or continuous underline pulse suggesting "system flow" or "real-time awareness"

---

## ⚙️ Interface Direction (Product UI)

**Layout:**
- Spacious, modular cards and live tiles — like a "founder's cockpit" but clean and minimal
- Generous whitespace
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Animations:**
- Smooth fades and real-time data transitions
- Subtle, not flashy
- Purpose-driven motion

**Tone:**
- Avoid "AI chat" aesthetics
- Instead, feel like a thinking workspace that's already aware
- Clean, professional, intelligent

**Microcopy Examples:**
- "COSOS has prioritized your week based on company performance."
- "3 projects are ahead of schedule. 1 needs your input."
- "Your business, in real time."

---

## 💬 Brand Voice

**Tone:**  
Calm, intelligent, composed — like a trusted Chief of Staff.

**Writing Style:**
- Declarative sentences ("See everything. Decide faster. Move in sync.")

- Emphasize clarity, awareness, and momentum
- Short, confident, understated — no marketing fluff

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Confident but not arrogant**
- **Intelligent but not complex**
- **Helpful but not chatty**
- **Premium but not pretentious**

- "Awareness that leads to action."
- "Where your tools think together."
- "Run with clarity, not chaos."
- "See everything. Decide faster. Move in sync."

1. **Calm over Chaos**: Every design decision should reduce cognitive load
2. **Precision over Flash**: Subtle, purposeful animations and interactions
