# STILLA.AI - DETAILED PRODUCT OVERVIEW

---

## **CORE VALUE PROPOSITION**

Stilla is an **AI agent that acts as an organizational memory and automation layer** for product development teams. The fundamental promise is captured in their tagline: **"Your team's unfair advantage"** - positioning it as a competitive differentiator rather than just another productivity tool.

The core value proposition centers on **eliminating organizational friction** by:
- **Automatically capturing and connecting context** across all communication channels (meetings, Slack, docs, repos)
- **Converting conversations into actions** without manual intervention
- **Maintaining institutional memory** that never forgets decisions, context, or rationale
- **Keeping tools synchronized** without requiring team members to switch contexts or update multiple systems

---

## **INITIAL VALUE GENERATION FOR CUSTOMERS**

The initial value Stilla delivers can be understood through **three immediate impact areas**:

### **1. Instant Context Retrieval (Memory Value)**
- **Pain solved**: "What did we decide 6 weeks ago?" - teams constantly lose track of past decisions
- **How Stilla delivers**: Acts as a queryable organizational memory that can surface exact decisions and their rationale on-demand
- **Time saved**: Eliminates hours spent searching through Slack threads, meeting notes, and documents

### **2. Automatic Task Management (Coordination Value)**
- **Pain solved**: Things mentioned in meetings or Slack fall through the cracks; project boards become outdated
- **How Stilla delivers**: Automatically creates and updates Linear issues from conversations, keeps boards in sync without manual updates
- **Immediate benefit**: Teams see their project management tools reflect reality without anyone manually updating them

### **3. Reduced Context Switching (Flow Value)**
- **Pain solved**: Engineers and PMs constantly context-switch between tools (Slack, Linear, GitHub, Notion) to understand status
- **How Stilla delivers**: Brings context to wherever the team is working - mention @stilla in Linear to get meeting context, ask in Slack about issue status
- **Productivity gain**: Team members stay in their primary work environment instead of tool-hopping

## **KEY PRODUCT CAPABILITIES**

### **Meeting Intelligence:**
- Records and processes meetings to extract decisions, action items, and context
- Automatically creates/updates Linear issues based on meeting discussions
- Provides searchable memory of "what was said" and "why decisions were made"

### **Multi-Tool Orchestration:**
- **Integrations**: Slack, Linear, GitHub, Notion (plus MCP client capabilities)
- Syncs information bidirectionally - doesn't just extract, but also writes and updates
- Maintains coherence across tools without requiring manual updates

### **Code-Aware Operations:**
- Reviews code repositories to understand technical context
- Can draft pull requests using context from meetings, docs, and existing code
- Understands technical decisions and their implementation status

### **Proactive Tracking:**
- Flags blockers automatically
- Tracks goals and progress without manual status updates
- Surfaces what needs attention

## **PRIMARY ICP (IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE)**

Based on the product capabilities and positioning, Stilla's primary ICP is:

### **Company Profile:**
- **Team Size**: 10-100 person product/engineering teams (sweet spot likely 20-50)
- **Type**: Fast-growing startups and scale-ups building software products
- **Stage**: Post-Series A through Series C companies
- **Tech Stack**: Modern dev teams using Slack, Linear, GitHub, Notion (their core integrations)
- **Geographic Focus**: Initially tech hubs (US, Europe, particularly Nordic region given their Stockholm base)

### **Buyer Personas:**

#### **Primary Decision Maker: Head of Product / VP Product**
- **Struggles with**: Alignment between product, engineering, design
- **Pain points**: Context loss between meetings, decisions not being executed, constant status updates
- **Buying motivation**: Team velocity, cross-functional coordination

#### **Secondary Influencer: VP Engineering / CTO**
- **Struggles with**: Engineers spending time on coordination instead of building
- **Pain points**: Technical context getting lost, PR reviews lacking context, duplicate work
- **Buying motivation**: Engineering productivity, reducing coordination overhead

#### **End Users:**
- Product Managers (heavy users - need to track decisions and context)
- Engineering Leads (use for technical context and PR drafting)
- Individual Engineers (use to get context on issues without meetings)
- Designers (passive beneficiaries through better alignment)

### **Key Characteristics of ICP:**
- **High meeting culture**: Teams that have frequent syncs, standups, planning meetings
- **Distributed/hybrid work**: Async communication is critical, context easily gets lost
- **Fast-paced**: Moves quickly, can't afford to slow down for manual coordination
- **Tool-savvy**: Already uses modern dev stack (Linear, not Jira; Slack, not email)
- **Quality-focused**: Cares about making good decisions, not just moving fast

### **Buying Triggers:**
- Team recently scaled past 20-30 people (coordination breaking down)
- Complaints about "we already discussed this" or "what did we decide?"
- Engineers frustrated about time spent on status updates vs. building
- Product-engineering misalignment causing rework or missed requirements
- Post-mortem revealing context was lost that led to problems

## **COMPETITIVE POSITIONING**

Stilla differentiates from:
- **Meeting note-takers** (Fireflies, Otter): Goes beyond transcription to take action
- **Workflow automation** (Zapier, Make): Context-aware, not just rule-based triggers
- **AI coding assistants** (GitHub Copilot, Cursor): Organizational memory + coordination, not just code completion
- **Project management tools**: Augments existing tools rather than replacing them

**The key differentiator** is **"quietly keeps track of everything"** - it's designed to be invisible infrastructure that makes the team more effective without requiring behavior change.

---

## **BUSINESS MODEL INDICATORS**

While not explicitly stated, the product suggests:
- **Pricing**: Likely per-seat SaaS, probably $30-75/user/month range
- **Sales motion**: Product-led growth with bottom-up adoption (can start with one team)
- **Land-and-expand**: Start with product team, expand to entire engineering org
- **Current stage**: Private beta (requesting early access via form)

---

## **STRATEGIC INSIGHTS**

### **Why this matters now:**
- Post-COVID remote/hybrid work has made organizational context harder to maintain
- AI agents are mature enough to reliably perform these coordination tasks
- Modern dev teams use 5-10+ tools, creating integration/context problems
- The "institutional knowledge" problem becomes acute as teams scale

### **What makes Stilla compelling:**
The product addresses a **"hidden tax"** that every growing startup pays - the overhead of coordination, alignment, and context management. This overhead compounds as teams grow, making it a perfect venture-scale opportunity. The fact they raised $4.5M at a $32M pre-money valuation (with General Catalyst backing) validates significant market belief in this problem space.

## **SUMMARY**

Stilla.ai is positioning itself as **essential infrastructure for modern product teams** - not a productivity hack, but a fundamental capability that high-performing teams will need as they scale. The product's genius lies in working invisibly within existing workflows, making adoption frictionless while delivering immediate, tangible value through better organizational memory and automatic coordination.
