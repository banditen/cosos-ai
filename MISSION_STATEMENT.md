**Last Updated:** December 5, 2025

## 🎯 Core Mission

**COSOS is building the business context layer that transforms how founders operate—from scattered information across tools to unified business intelligence that keeps teams aligned and moving forward.**

### The Vision: Your Business Context API

We're not building another tool. We're building the **intelligence layer** that sits between all your existing tools and understands:
- Your goals, strategy, and why decisions were made
- How your metrics connect to your business objectives  
- What your team is working on and how it aligns
- The context behind every conversation, ticket, and change

**COSOS becomes the institutional memory and strategic advisor that never forgets and always connects the dots.**

## 🏗️ The Four-Phase Journey

### Phase 1: Business Context Layer ⭐ **CURRENT FOCUS**
**Goal:** Plug into existing tools, understand your business context

**What we're building:**
- Slack integration that answers strategic questions
- Linear integration that connects tickets to business goals
- Notion integration that understands your strategy docs
- GitHub integration that links code to business impact
- Cross-tool synthesis that maintains alignment

**Value delivered:**
- "Why did we decide this?" → Instant context from past decisions
- "What's our Q4 priority?" → Real-time goal tracking across tools
- "How does this ticket relate to our goals?" → Strategic alignment
- "What changed in our metrics?" → Business context, not just numbers

### Phase 2: Proactive Intelligence (Q1 2026)
**Goal:** From reactive answers to proactive insights

**What we'll build:**
- Daily strategic briefs based on cross-tool activity
- Automatic goal progress tracking and alerts
- Decision impact analysis ("This change affected activation by 12%")
- Strategic drift detection ("Team is working on things not aligned with Q4 goals")

### Phase 3: Autonomous Subagents (Q2-Q3 2026)
**Goal:** Specialized agents that operate within business context

**What we'll build:**
- Sales Agent (monitors pipeline, connects to revenue goals)
- Product Agent (tracks user feedback, links to product strategy)
- Engineering Agent (connects code changes to business outcomes)
- Finance Agent (explains metric changes in strategic context)

### Phase 4: Decision Infrastructure (Q4 2026+)
**Goal:** Horizontal intelligence that coordinates business operations

**What we'll build:**
- Cross-domain decision making with business context
- Autonomous execution of low-risk decisions
- Strategic recommendations with full historical context
- Complete business operating system

## 🔒 Security & Privacy: Non-Negotiable

**Your context is yours. Your intelligence is yours. Period.**

### Core Security Principles:
- **Zero-trust architecture** - Every integration is sandboxed
- **Minimal permissions** - Only read what's necessary for context
- **Local processing** - Sensitive analysis happens in your environment
- **Audit everything** - Complete transparency of what Cosos knows
- **Your data never trains our models** - Context stays private

## 🎯 Why We Win: The Context Advantage

### vs Generic AI Assistants (ChatGPT, Claude):
- **Them:** Generic knowledge, no business context
- **Us:** Deep understanding of YOUR specific business, goals, and history

### vs Business Intelligence Tools (Tableau, Looker):
- **Them:** Show you data, you figure out what it means
- **Us:** Explain what data means in the context of your strategy

### vs Workflow Tools (Zapier, Make):
- **Them:** Connect tools mechanically
- **Us:** Connect tools intelligently with business understanding

## The Unique Value

**"Fits right in"**
> Slack, Linear, Notion, GitHub, Stripe. Cosos connects your business context without changing how your team works.

**"Keeps you aligned"** 
> No more "What's our Q4 goal again?" or "Why did we decide this?" Cosos knows your strategy and keeps everyone on the same page.

**"Never loses context"**
> Remember that pivot decision from two months ago? Cosos does. And it can tell you how it's affecting your metrics today.
